# milesPerGallon
Create a project that calculates miles per gallon for a given trip, and accumulates the miles and gallons to calculate an overall MPG for the vehicle.  

Create a class named MPG that includes private instance variables for miles, gallons, and mpg, which are doubles. Add class variables for totalMiles, totalGallons, and totalMPG, which are doubles, and numTrips, which is an integer. Create a constructor which accepts 2 double parameters, one for miles, one for gallons. Inside the constructor, set the instance variables for miles and gallons, and calculate the mpg. Add to the class variables for totalMiles and TotalGallons, and increment the number of trips.  

Create an instance method named displayCurrentMPG( ) which displays the MPG variable for a specific trip object. Create a class method named displayTotalMPG( ) which calculates and displays the overall MPG for all of the trip objects.  

The driver class will instantiate 4 trips, display the MPG for each trip, and display the overall MPG.  

For the sample session, use the following values:  
Trip1:    miles = 320,        gallons = 29  
Trip2:     miles = 325.8,    gallons = 32.1  
Trip3:    miles = 412.5,    gallons = 35  
Trip4:    miles = 345,        gallons = 32.6  

Note that these 4 trips test all the possible combinations of variable types – 2 integers, 2 doubles, 1 integer and 1 double, 1 double and 1 integer. It’s always good practice to test all possible situation.  

Once the program works as it should to match the sample session, run the project twice more, with different numbers for every trip, and take screenshots of the results.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
